My name is Dimitar and I am creating the user interface middleware for your
next game at [Coherent Labs](https://coherent-labs.com).

This is my blog about software development and includes my notes from this
*rally* - from an idea to a product. Topics range from coding, mostly in C++,
through practices to management.

You can reach me via [email](mailto:dimitar@coherent-labs.com),
