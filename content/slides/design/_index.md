## Up front design

Up front design in an iterative and incremental process.

Stop when:
- you understand the significant architectural drivers (requirements, quality
  attributes, constraints)
- you understand the context and scope of what you are building
- you undeerstand the significant design decisions (technology, modularity, etc)
- you have a way to communicate your technical vision to other people
- you are confident that your design satisfies the key architectural drivers
- you have identified, and are comfortable with, the risks associated with
  building the software
